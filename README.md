python files:
exceloutput runs the tests several times, single graph runs it once but displays the graph and lets the user pick the seed. 
all py files require NetworkX (https://networkx.org/), the excel output one also requires Pandas (https://pandas.pydata.org/).

for excel files:
clusteringtest shows raw output data used to selection our four benchmark graphs generations.
graphtests show raw output data and graphs that came from running the excel output file several times on the graphs selected from clusteringtest.
